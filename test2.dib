you can use dotnet run to run code. its not recommended for publishing sites or anything like that. there is a serparate command for that

you kind of use .net like terminal. it has a lot of tools and features that you access through the terminal, it doesn't work the same out of the box as other languages and frameworks that i have used so far  but i feel like i am starting to understand things a lot more. i want to watch people code in c# and i feel like that will help me get a grasp of things even more. on top of all of the things that i have already been doing.

#!csharp

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
