This is a project I worked on to help me learn C#, it's also something that will help me save time.

Creating the basic folder and file structure for a project is tedious, to help myself with that i deceided to make an automation script that automatically downloads the necessarily dependencies and creates that file structure. It works for a basic FullStack Site, it download the necessary dependencies for tailwind, typescript, react, and mongoose. It also downloads additional things to make aspects of programming easier like axios, dotenv, and cors. It will open the terminal and a new vs code window so you can keep track of all the things it is doing. When it's completely finished it will run npm start in the terminal to show you a live preview of your site. It is meant to be used from your home screen(personally I have it stored as a file on desktop with a handpicked icon). You can accomplish this by going into the bin folder -> going into release -> adding c#-work.exe to your homescreen. From there all you should have to do is double click it. This was fun and I plan on making more scripts in the future.
